## What Was Completed

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Previously Done)
- ✅ Dashboard page with system overview
- ✅ Agents list and detail pages
- ✅ API client integration
- ✅ Sidebar navigation
- ✅ Manual manifest sync

### Phase 2: Additional Manifest Types (Just Completed)
- ✅ **Tools Pages** - List and detail views

## Features by Page

### Tools Page (`/tools`)
- Fetch tools from `/registry/tools`
- Display tool cards with:
  - Name, summary, author, state
  - Parameter count
  - Version info
- Filter by state (All/Stable/Unstable)
- Navigate to detail view
- Sync button to reload manifests
- Execute button (disabled - future feature)

### Tool Detail Page (`/tools/[name]`)
- Fetch manifest from `/registry/manifest/Tool/{name}`
- Display sections:
  - Basic information (author, state, version)
  - Implementation details (type, handler)
  - Parameters schema (with types and descriptions)
  - Return value specification
- Actions: Execute (disabled), Edit (disabled), Refresh

### Relics Page (`/relics`)
- Fetch relics from `/registry/relics`
- Display relic cards with:
  - Name, summary, author, state
  - Deployment type and port
  - Version info
- Filter by state
- Deploy button (disabled - future feature)

### Relic Detail Page (`/relics/[name]`)
- Fetch manifest from `/registry/manifest/Relic/{name}`
- Display sections:
  - Basic information
  - Deployment configuration (type, port, protocol, health check)
  - Imported resources (agents, tools)
  - Environment variables
- Actions: Deploy (disabled), Edit (disabled), Refresh

### Workflows Page (`/workflows`)
- Fetch workflows from `/registry/workflows`

  - Name, summary, author, state
  - Steps count
  - Trigger type (event/schedule/manual)
  - Version info
- Filter by state
- Execute button (disabled - future feature)

### Workflow Detail Page (`/workflows/[name]`)

- Display sections:
  - Basic information
  - Triggers configuration
  - Sequential steps visualization with flow indicators
  - Environment variables
- Actions: Execute (disabled), Edit (disabled), Refresh

---

## API Integration

All pages use the centralized API client (`lib/api/client.ts`):

```typescript
// Tools
api.manifests.listTools()
api.manifests.getTool(name)

// Relics
api.manifests.listRelics()
api.manifests.getRelic(name)

// Workflows
api.manifests.listWorkflows()
api.manifests.getWorkflow(name)

// Sync
api.manifests.sync()
```

---

## Design Patterns

All pages follow consistent patterns:

1. **List Pages**:
   - Header with title, description, sync button
   - Tabs for filtering (All/Stable/Unstable)
   - Grid layout with cards (3 columns on large screens)
   - Loading state with spinner
   - Empty state with illustration and sync button
   - Card actions: View, Execute/Deploy (disabled)

2. **Detail Pages**:
   - Back button to list view
   - Header with icon, name, version, state badge
   - Grid layout for info cards
   - Expandable sections for complex data
   - Actions footer: Primary action (disabled), Edit (disabled), Refresh

3. **UI Components**:
   - shadcn/ui components (Card, Badge, Button, Tabs)
   - Lucide icons (consistent with sidebar)
   - Dark mode support
   - Hover states and transitions

## Commands

```bash
# Development
cd services/b-line
npm run dev           # Start dev server (localhost:3000)

## Integration Complete ✨

The B-Line dashboard now provides a **complete, modern web interface** for browsing and managing all Cortex-Prime manifest types. Users can:

1. View system overview and health status
2. Browse and filter agents, tools, relics, and workflows
3. View detailed manifest information for each resource
4. Manually sync manifests from the file system
5. Navigate seamlessly between different resource types

**Next Step:** Deploy and test with real manifests in the full stack environment.
