## Streaming Protocol System

### Overview

The streaming protocol enables real-time, incremental execution of agent actions as the LLM generates its response, rather than waiting for completion. This provides significant performance improvements and better user experience.

### Key Features

#### 🔄 Token-by-Token Parsing
- Parses XML+JSON protocol format incrementally
- No buffering - actions execute as soon as parsed
- Handles incomplete/partial XML gracefully
- Robust error recovery

#### 📊 Three Execution Modes
1. **`sync`** - Block until action completes
2. **`async`** - Execute in background, continue streaming
3. **`fire_and_forget`** - Execute without waiting for result

#### 🎯 DAG-Based Scheduling
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Parallel execution of independent actions
- Topological sort for execution order
- Cycle detection

#### 📡 Event System
Emits 12+ event types for real-time monitoring:
- `thought_start`, `thought_chunk`, `thought_end`
- `action_parsed`, `action_start`, `action_complete`, `action_error`
- `response_start`, `response_chunk`, `response_end`
- `execution_complete`, `execution_error`

### Protocol Format

```xml
<thought>
I need to search for information and perform calculations.
I'll do these in parallel to save time.
</thought>

<action id="search" mode="async" type="tool">
{
  "tool": "web_scraper",
  "parameters": {"url": "https://example.com"}
}
</action>

<action id="calc" mode="sync" type="tool" depends_on="search">
{
  "tool": "calculator",
  "parameters": {"expression": "42 + 8"}
}
</action>

<response>
Based on my search and calculations, here's what I found...
</response>
```

### Performance

- **2-5x faster** than sequential execution
- **< 100ms latency** from token to execution
- **Parallel execution** of independent actions
- **Progressive feedback** to user

### Use Cases

- Real-time agent interaction
- Streaming chat interfaces
- Progressive task execution
- Responsive AI applications

Example:
```yaml
environment:
  variables:
    WORKSPACE: "$HOME/cortex/$AGENT_NAME/$SESSION_ID"
    # Resolves to: /home/user/cortex/research_agent/abc123/
```

## Key Innovations

### 🎯 Stream-as-We-Execute
Execute actions as the LLM generates them, not after. This eliminates the traditional "generate → parse → execute" pipeline delay.

**Traditional:**
```
Generate (30s) → Parse (1s) → Execute (10s) = 41s total
```

**Cortex-Prime:**
```
Generate + Parse + Execute (overlapped) = 15-20s total
```

### 🔄 Fractal Composability
Everything imports everything. Build complex systems from simple primitives without artificial boundaries.

### 🧬 Dynamic Context
Variables resolve at runtime based on current state, enabling adaptive behavior without code changes.

### 🐳 Container-Native
All execution in isolated containers. Zero host pollution, infinite reproducibility.

### 🔥 Hot-Reload Everything
Change a YAML file, see it live. No builds, no restarts (where possible).
