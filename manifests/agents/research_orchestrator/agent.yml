# ==============================================================================
# Complex hierarchical agent with sub-agents, tools, relics, and workflows

# --- I. IDENTITY & METADATA ---
description: |
  A sophisticated research orchestrator that delegates work to specialized
  sub-agents, manages research relics, and coordinates complex workflows.
  Demonstrates the fractal, composable manifest design philosophy with
  complete local implementations - no global dependencies.

# --- II. BEHAVIORAL PROFILE ---
persona:
  agent: "./system-prompts/research_orchestrator.md"

agency_level: "autonomous"  # Highest autonomy for complex orchestration
grade: "rare"  # Higher priority resource allocation
iteration_cap: 20

# --- III. COGNITIVE ENGINE ---
cognitive_engine:
  primary:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-pro"  # More powerful model for orchestration
  
  fallback:
    provider: "ollama"
    model: "llama3.1:70b"
  
  parameters:
    temperature: 0.3  # Lower for precise orchestration
    top_p: 0.9
    max_tokens: 8192
    stream: true

# --- IV. CAPABILITY GRANTS & DEPENDENCIES ---
# Fractal composition: All components are local, demonstrating modularity
