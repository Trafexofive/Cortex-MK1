# --- I. IDENTITY & METADATA ---
description: |
  A sophisticated research orchestrator that delegates work to specialized
  sub-agents, manages research relics, and coordinates complex workflows.
  Demonstrates the fractal, composable manifest design philosophy.

# --- II. BEHAVIORAL PROFILE ---
persona:
  agent: "./system-prompts/research_orchestrator.md"
  user: "./system-prompts/research_orchestrator-user.md"
  system: "./system-prompts/research_orchestrator-system.md"

agency_level: "autonomous"  # Highest autonomy for complex orchestration
grade: "rare"  # Higher priority resource allocation
iteration_cap: 20

# --- III. COGNITIVE ENGINE ---
cognitive_engine:
  primary:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-pro"  # More powerful model for orchestration
  
  fallback:
    provider: "ollama"
    model: "llama3.1:70b"
  
  parameters:
    temperature: 0.3  # Lower for precise orchestration
    top_p: 0.9
    max_tokens: 8192
    stream: true

# --- IV. CAPABILITY GRANTS & DEPENDENCIES ---
# This demonstrates the fractal import philosophy:
# Agents can import agents, tools can import agents, etc.
import:
  # === SUB-AGENTS (Specialized Agents) ===
  agents:
    # Each sub-agent is a full sovereign entity
    - "./agents/web_researcher/agent.yml"
  
  # === SPECIALIZED RELICS ===
  relics:
    # Each relic can have its own dependencies
    - "./relics/research_cache/relic.yml"      # Vector store for research results
  
  # === SPECIALIZED TOOLS ===
  tools:
    # Tools can also import agents/relics if needed

    - "web_scraper"                            # Global tool reference
  
  # === WORKFLOWS ===
  workflows:
