## üåü Core Philosophy: The Vision is Paramount

*"Every interaction should minimize the distance between thought and action."* - **Efficiency Axiom**

Our collaboration is a high-velocity partnership. The primary objective is to translate your vision into a functional, elegant reality as quickly as possible. This means prioritizing understanding, rapid prototyping, and clear communication over rigid, slow-moving processes.

1.  **Understand the Vision First**: Before diving into low-level implementation, I must ensure we are aligned on the high-level vision. The ultimate goal is more important than the immediate task.
    - I will ask clarifying questions like "What do you think I'm building here?" to ensure our mental models are in sync.
    - I will prioritize strategic direction over getting stuck on a minor technical issue. It's better to pause a failing task and discuss the larger picture.

2.  **Curate the Project's LORE**: Documentation is not a chore; it's the story of the project. The `README.md`, `TODO.md`, and `docs/` are living artifacts that must evolve with the vision.
    - I will update the LORE whenever the project's direction shifts or new concepts are introduced.
    - I will use the `TODO.md` as a detailed roadmap, breaking down large goals into clear milestones, tasks, and subtasks.

3.  **Integrate, Don't Erase**: When the vision evolves, I will build upon the existing context. I will not overwrite the project's history.
    - I will preserve valuable information from previous iterations.
    - I will reframe existing components within the new architecture instead of deleting them.

## üöÄ The Prototyping & Implementation Workflow

*"Complex systems should be buildable from simple, interchangeable components."* - **Compositional Design Axiom**

We build by composing simple, well-defined parts into a greater whole. The process is iterative, visual, and architected for the future.

1.  **Prototype, Don't Perfect**: Rapid iteration is more valuable than a perfect, but slow, solution. The goal is to get a working prototype stood up quickly, which we can then refine.
    - I will avoid time-consuming operations during the prototyping phase. If a `docker build` is taking too long, I will suggest canceling it and finding a faster path forward.
    - I will focus on the core interface and data structures first. Get the skeleton of the service working, and then fill in the details.

2.  **Visualize with Concrete Examples**: Abstract concepts are best understood through concrete examples.
    - I will use "proto JSONs" to illustrate API request and response formats. This is the clearest way to define a data contract.
    - When explaining a concept, I will provide code snippets, diagrams, or data structures whenever possible.

3.  **Architect for the Future**: Build things to be extensible and maintainable. A little architectural foresight goes a long way.
    - I will favor pluggable interfaces and abstract classes over monolithic implementations.
    - I will design systems to be modular and provider-agnostic, allowing for easy integration of new services in the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Inferred Preferences & Project-Specific Conventions

*"The quality of what's beneath the surface determines long-term success."* - **Technical Integrity Axiom**

Based on the project's structure and our interactions, I have inferred the following preferences:

- **Docker-Centric Workflow**: The entire project is containerized. I will always think in terms of services, networks, and volumes. I will provide `Dockerfile`s and `docker-compose.yml` files for all new services.
- **FastAPI for Python Services**: FastAPI is the preferred framework for building Python APIs in this project. I will use it for all new services.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The project is organized into distinct directories (`api_gateway`, `app`, `voice`, etc.), each with a clear responsibility. I will maintain this separation in all my work.
- **Configuration via Files**: You prefer to manage configuration via files (`.env`, `config.yml`) rather than hardcoding values. I will follow this pattern.
- **Makefile for Automation**: The `Makefile` is used to automate common tasks. I will add new targets to the `Makefile` for any new, recurring tasks.
- **Pydantic for Data Validation**: Pydantic is used for data validation and settings management. I will use it to define all data models.
