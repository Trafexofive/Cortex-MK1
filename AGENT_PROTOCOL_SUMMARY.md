## Key Features

### ✅ Async/Sync Action Execution

Actions can be executed in three modes:

- **SYNC**: Wait for completion (critical path operations)
- **ASYNC**: Run in background, collect result later (parallel operations)
- **FIRE_AND_FORGET**: Execute and don't wait (logging, caching)

### ✅ Dependency Resolution

Actions specify dependencies with `depends_on`:
```python
Action(
    name="analyze",
    depends_on=["fetch_data_1", "fetch_data_2"],
    wait_for_all=True  # Wait for both to complete
)
```

The executor builds a DAG and validates for circular dependencies.

### ✅ Wave-Based Parallel Execution

Actions are executed in "waves" based on dependency resolution:

**Wave 1**: All independent actions (run in parallel)  
**Wave 2**: Actions depending on Wave 1 (run in parallel)  
**Wave 3**: Actions depending on Wave 2...  
...and so on

### ✅ Streaming Results

Real-time events as execution progresses:
```python
async for event in executor.execute_agent_loop():
    if event.event_type == "action_completed":
        print(f"✅ {event.action_name} completed!")
        print(f"Output: {event.data['output']}")
```

### ✅ Context Persistence

Shared context across all actions and iterations:
```python
Action(
    name="fetch",
    output_key="data"  # Store result as $data
)

Action(
    name="process",
    parameters={"input": "$data"}  # Reference it
)
```

### ✅ Resource Control

- Timeout per action
- Max parallel actions
- Retry policies
- Fail-fast support
- Resource limits

## Architecture Comparison

### Old Model (v1.0) - Sequential
```
Iteration 1:
  └─ LLM plans action
      └─ Execute action (wait)
          └─ Update context
              └─ LLM plans next action
                  └─ Execute action (wait)
                      └─ ...

Problems:
  ❌ One action at a time
  ❌ No parallelism
  ❌ Slow execution
  ❌ Poor resource utilization
```

### New Model (v2.0) - Streaming + Parallel
```
Iteration 1:
  └─ LLM plans all actions at once
      └─ Build dependency graph
          └─ Execute in waves (parallel)
              ├─ Action 1 (async) ───┐
              ├─ Action 2 (async) ───┼─> Stream results as completed
              └─ Action 3 (async) ───┘
          └─ Next wave (dependencies met)
              └─ Action 4 (depends on 1,2,3)

Benefits:
  ✅ Multiple actions simultaneously
  ✅ Stream results in real-time
  ✅ Better resource usage
  ✅ 1.4x - 5x faster execution
  ✅ More responsive UX
```

## Event Types

### Execution Flow Events
- `agent_started` - Agent begins execution
- `iteration_started` - New iteration begins
- `plan_generated` - LLM created execution plan
- `action_started` - Action execution begins
- `action_completed` - Action finished successfully
- `action_failed` - Action encountered error
- `iteration_completed` - Iteration finished
- `agent_completed` - Agent execution complete

### Streaming Events
- `llm_token` - LLM streaming token (for real-time output)
- `thought` - Agent reasoning/thought process
- `progress` - Execution progress update

---

## Usage Example

```python
from agent_loop_executor import AgentLoopExecutor
from models.agent_execution_protocol import (
    Action, ActionType, ActionMode, AgentLoopProtocol
)

# Configure protocol
protocol = AgentLoopProtocol(
    mode="autonomous",
    max_iterations=10,
    stream_action_results=True,
    allow_parallel_actions=True,
    max_parallel_actions=5
)

# Create executor
executor = AgentLoopExecutor(
    agent_name="research_agent",
    protocol=protocol,
    tool_executor=tool_exec,
    llm_client=llm
)

# Execute with streaming
async for event in executor.execute_agent_loop():
    if event.event_type == "action_completed":
        print(f"✅ {event.action_name}: {event.data['output']}")
    elif event.event_type == "llm_token":
        print(event.data['token'], end='', flush=True)
```
