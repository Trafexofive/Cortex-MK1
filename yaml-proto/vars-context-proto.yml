thoughts:
- type: PLAN
  content: The build is complete. Now I need to analyze the build output for warnings.
    I will use the 'static_analyzer' tool and pass it the 'task_id' of the build,
    which I have stored as an internal variable 'last_build_id'.
- type: ASSUMPTION
  content: I am assuming the 'static_analyzer' tool can retrieve the build logs using
    the task ID.
