# agent fleet summon prompt.
summon an agent fleet, needed them to look for all and any cheap compute in morocco, compute blades, rasberry pies, decomitionned old servers, cheap optiplexes, broken laptops ....

need to add global report look up, of course UX in mind, from there I should be able to go to the appropriate  agent/workspace.

need to add the settings page, put the themes in there, the ability to add and use multiple API keys, as well as auto-switching on resource exhaustion.

each workspace will also have a settings page, full of togglables, from the automation to the other features.
