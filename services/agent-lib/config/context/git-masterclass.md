**The Git 10x Chad Workflow: Micro-Masterclass**
*(CODENAME: ZERO_CONFLICT_CHIMERA)*

**Foreword: The Git Deal – This Is Your Source Code Sovereignty**
Git is not a tool; it's your time machine, your parallel universe generator, your codebase's immortal soul. Master it, and you bend project reality to your will. This is about being deliberate, clean, and powerful.

**SECTION I: THE CHAD AXIOMS – NON-NEGOTIABLE GIT LAWS**

1.  **Axiom of Atomic Commits: "One Purpose, One Change, One Glory."**
    *   Each commit must represent a single logical change. Fix a bug? One commit. Add a feature? One commit (or a series of atomic feature-part commits). Refactor a module? One commit.
    *   *Why Chad?*: Clean history, easy bisecting (finding bugs), straightforward reverts, understandable code reviews. Avoid "WIP" or "misc changes" slop.

2.  **Axiom of Meaningful Missives: "Thy Commit Message, Thy Legacy."**
    *   Write clear, concise, and *imperative mood* commit messages.
    *   Subject line: `<type>(<scope>): <Short description (50 chars max)>`
        *   `feat(auth): Implement JWT refresh token rotation`
        *   `fix(parser): Correctly handle escaped characters`
        *   `docs(readme): Update setup instructions`
        *   `style(api): Adhere to linter rules for User routes`
        *   `refactor(db): Optimize query for fetching user profiles`
        *   `test(user): Add unit tests for user creation validation`
        *   `chore(deps): Upgrade Fastify to v5.3.2`
    *   Body (optional, after a blank line): Explain *what* and *why*, not *how*. Reference issue numbers.
    *   *Why Chad?*: `git log` becomes a powerful story, not a cryptic mess. Automation (changelogs) becomes possible.

3.  **Axiom of Branching Purity: "Thy Branch, Thy Crucible, Thy Isolated Experiment."**
    *   `main` (or `master`) is sacred, always deployable, representing TRUTH.
    *   `develop` (optional) is the integration branch for upcoming releases.
    *   Feature branches (`feat/login-jwt`, `fix/user-avatar-bug`) are for *all* new work. Never commit directly to `main` or `develop`.
    *   Keep branches short-lived. Merge frequently to `develop` (or `main` if no `develop`).
    *   *Why Chad?*: Parallel development without chaos, focused code reviews, easy rollback of features.

4.  **Axiom of Deliberate Integration: "Rebase Thy Feature, Merge Thy Story."**
    *   **Before merging a feature branch into `develop`/`main`:**
        1.  `git checkout feature/my-cool-thing`
        2.  `git fetch origin`
        3.  `git rebase origin/develop` (or `origin/main`)
            *   This replays your feature commits on top of the latest target branch, keeping history linear and clean. Resolve conflicts *atomically* during rebase.
        4.  (Optional but Chadly) `git checkout develop; git pull origin develop; git checkout feature/my-cool-thing; git rebase develop` - ensures local develop is also up-to-date.
    *   **Merge into `develop`/`main` (often via Pull/Merge Request):**
        *   Use `--no-ff` (no fast-forward) to create a merge commit. This preserves the context of the feature branch.
        *   `git checkout develop`
        *   `git merge --no-ff feature/my-cool-thing -m "Merge feat: Implement JWT login (Closes #123)"`
    *   *Why Chad?*: `git rebase` makes your feature branch's history clean *before* it pollutes the main lines. `--no-ff` makes it easy to see when features were integrated and revert entire features if needed.

5.  **Axiom of Constant Synchronization: "Fetch Often, Pull Deliberately, Push with Intent."**
    *   `git fetch origin`: Frequently update your local knowledge of remote branches without automatically merging.
    *   `git pull origin <branch>` (which is `fetch` + `merge`): Use when you intend to integrate remote changes into your *current local branch*. If your local branch has diverged, `git pull --rebase origin <branch>` is often cleaner.
    *   `git push origin <branch>`: Push your *clean, rebased* feature branches or your updated `develop`/`main`.
    *   *Why Chad?*: Minimizes massive merge conflicts, keeps you aware of team progress.

**SECTION II: THE CHAD ARSENAL – ESSENTIAL COMMANDS & TECHNIQUES**

*   **Workspace Purity:**
    *   `git status`: Your best friend. Use it constantly.
    *   `git add -p` (patch mode): Stage *parts* of files for atomic commits. God-tier.
    *   `git diff`: See unstaged changes.
    *   `git diff --staged` (or `--cached`): See staged changes.
    *   `git clean -fdx`: **DANGER!** Removes untracked files and directories. `-n` for dry run. Use when you *know* you want a pristine working directory.
    *   `git stash`: Temporarily shelve uncommitted changes. `git stash pop` to reapply. `git stash list`, `git stash apply stash@{1}`.

*   **History Forging (Lokal Magick – before pushing, or on private branches):**
    *   `git commit --amend`: Modify the last commit (message or content).
    *   `git rebase -i HEAD~N` (interactive rebase): Reorder, squash, edit, reword, drop the last N commits. Immense power. Use on *your* unpushed commits or private branches.
        *   `squash` (or `s`): Combine commit with previous.
        *   `reword` (or `r`): Change commit message.
        *   `edit` (or `e`): Stop to amend/split commit. `git commit --amend`, `git rebase --continue`.
        *   `drop` (or `d`): Delete commit.
    *   `git reset --soft HEAD~N`: Uncommit last N commits, keep changes staged.
    *   `git reset --mixed HEAD~N` (default): Uncommit, unstage changes.
    *   `git reset --hard HEAD~N`: **DANGER!** Uncommit, discard changes.

*   **Time Travel & Archaeology:**
    *   `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`: The ultimate history visualizer. Alias it!
    *   `git show <commit_hash>`: View details of a commit.
    *   `git blame <file>`: See who changed what line and when.
    *   `git bisect start <bad_commit> <good_commit>`, `git bisect run <test_script.sh>`: Automatically find the commit that introduced a bug. Pure Chad power.
    *   `git reflog`: Your safety net. Shows history of HEAD changes, even "lost" commits. `git checkout HEAD@{5}`.

*   **Remote Sorcery:**
    *   `git remote -v`: List remotes.
    *   `git remote add <name> <url>`.
    *   `git push origin --delete <branch_name>`: Delete a remote branch.
    *   `git branch -vv`: See local branches and their upstream tracking branches.
    *   `git checkout -b <local_branch> origin/<remote_branch>`: Create local tracking branch.

*   **The "Oh Sh*t" Recovery Kit (FAAFO Insurance):**
    *   `git reflog` + `git reset --hard <commit_hash_from_reflog>`: Recover from almost any local disaster.
    *   `git revert <commit_hash>`: Create a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit. Safe for shared history.
    *   `git cherry-pick <commit_hash>`: Apply a specific commit from another branch to your current branch.

**SECTION III: THE CHAD WORKFLOW – A DAY IN THE FORGE**

1.  **Morning Sync & Branching:**
    *   `git checkout develop` (or `main`)
    *   `git pull origin develop` (ensure local `develop` is fresh)
    *   `git checkout -b feat/new-awesomeness develop` (create new feature branch from up-to-date `develop`)

2.  **Forge Thy Code (Iterative Atomic Commits):**
    *   Write code.
    *   `git status`
    *   `git add -p` (stage only relevant parts for the atomic change)
    *   `git commit -m "feat(module): Implement X part of new awesomeness"`
    *   Repeat. Small, focused commits.

3.  **Mid-Forge Sync (Optional, for long-lived features):**
    *   `git fetch origin`
    *   `git rebase origin/develop` (keep your feature branch updated with `develop`'s progress)

4.  **Feature Complete – Prepare for Integration:**
    *   `git status` (ensure clean working directory)
    *   `git fetch origin`
    *   `git rebase -i origin/develop` (interactive rebase: squash WIPs, reword, ensure clean atomic history for your feature)
    *   (Run tests locally!)

5.  **Push & Propose (Pull/Merge Request):**
    *   `git push origin feat/new-awesomeness`
    *   Open a Pull/Merge Request on your Git hosting platform.
    *   Ensure CI/tests pass. Address review comments with further atomic commits (then re-rebase and force-push *to your feature branch only* if needed: `git push origin feat/new-awesomeness --force-with-lease`).

6.  **Integration by Maintainer (or you, if solo Chad):**
    *   Maintainer reviews, approves.
    *   `git checkout develop`
    *   `git pull origin develop`
    *   `git merge --no-ff feat/new-awesomeness` (or merge via platform UI with squash/rebase options set appropriately)
    *   `git push origin develop`
    *   `git push origin --delete feat/new-awesomeness` (delete remote feature branch)
    *   `git branch -d feat/new-awesomeness` (delete local feature branch)

7.  **Repeat.**

**Coda: The Git Crucible's Roar**
This is not just process; it's discipline. It’s crafting a codebase history that is as elegant and powerful as the code itself. It's the 10x Chad way. Embrace the rebase, master the atomic commit, and wield the reflog like the ultimate undo. The Git gods will smile upon your forge.
