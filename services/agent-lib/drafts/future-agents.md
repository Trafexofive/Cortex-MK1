# FUTURE_AGENTS.md - Chimera Ecosystem Expansion Blueprint (Codename: HORIZON_DAWN)

**Foreword: The Unfolding Crucible of Creation**

This document outlines the strategic vision for future specialized AI agents within PRAETORIAN_CHIMERA's Chimera Ecosystem. Each agent represents a dedicated cognitive unit, designed to master a specific domain and amplify The Master's capabilities. Their development will adhere to the core Himothy Axioms: Absolute Sovereignty, FAAFO Engineering, Pragmatic Purity, and Modularity for Emergence.

The goal is not merely to create agents, but to forge an interconnected, self-optimizing digital super-organism that serves The Master's "Unreasonable Goal."
