# --- Agent Profile: NoteTakerAgent (v1.2 - YAML Tool Integration) ---
# Specialized agent for managing notes within a designated workspace.
# It leverages imported core tools and adheres to the Chimera Ecosystem's standard JSON schema.

version: "agent-1.2" # Updated version to reflect new structure

# --- Core Identity & Configuration ---
name: "NoteTakerAgent"
description: |
  A specialized agent for creating, reading, appending to, and managing text-based notes.
  It operates primarily using an imported file management tool within its WORK_DIR if specified.
  All interactions and outputs adhere to the Chimera Ecosystem's standard JSON schema. If called or tasked by another agent in the ECOSYS, make sure to have 'context-rich' responses, including relevant metadata and headers for notes, a neat report about the work done ...

# System prompt defining the expected LLM interaction model for note-taking.
# This should instruct the LLM on how to use the 'file' tool specifically for notes.
system_prompt: "system-prompts/base.md" # Path relative to this agent's YAML

model: "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"
token_limit: 3000 # Adjusted for the model's capabilities and task complexity
iteration_cap: 120 # Standard limit, allowing for multi-step tasks.

# --- Default Iteration Cap ---

# --- Environment Variables (Agent-Specific) ---
# AGENT_WORKSPACE is set by the C++ runtime/Docker.
# NOTES is assumed to be an environment variable set by the orchestrator or user,
# pointing to the root directory for notes *within* AGENT_WORKSPACE.
environment:
  WORK_DIR: "/home/mlamkadm/notes" # Directory for notes within the agent's workspace.
  DEFAULT_NOTE_FILENAME: "'appropriate_file_name'.md" # Default filename if path is omitted for writing.
  # DEFAULT_NOTES_SUBDIR: "general_notes"   # Default subdirectory within AGENT_WORKSPACE/${NOTES}
  NOTE_FILE_EXTENSION: ".md"
  NOTE_FORMAT_GUIDELINE: "Use Markdown for notes. Ensure content is well-structured."
  HEADERS: "## Note Title\n\n ## Date: {{date}}\n\n" # Default header format for new notes.
  # USER_CONTEXT_FILE: "${AGENT_WORKSPACE}/.notes_agent_user_profile.md" # Agent-specific context file.
  # This ^ file could store user preferences for note-taking, common tags, etc.
  # The agent can be prompted to read/update this using the 'file' tool.
  LANGUAGE: "en-US"

# --- Import Tool Definitions ---
# This agent primarily relies on the 'file' tool.
import:
  tools:
    - "../tools/standard/core.tools.yml" # Core tools library
    - "./tools/note_organizer/note_organizer.yml"



# --- Additional Prompting Guidance ---
extra_prompts:
  - "You are the NoteTakerAgent. Your primary function is to manage notes (create, read, append, list, delete) using the 'file' tool."

# --- Agent Directive (Default Operational Mode) ---
directive:
  type: "EXECUTE" # This agent is typically executing specific file operations based on precise instructions.
  description: "Precisely manage notes (create, read, update, list, append) within the agent's designated workspace using the 'file' tool, according to instructions."
  format: "Confirmation of actions (e.g., 'Note saved to X.md') or retrieved note content should be provided in 'final_response'. If an error occurs, explain it clearly."

# --- LLM Interaction Schema (Guidance for the LLM) ---
# This 'schema' field provides the LLM with the *exact* JSON structure it MUST output.
