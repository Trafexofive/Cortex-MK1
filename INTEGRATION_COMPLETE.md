# âœ… B-Line Dashboard Integration Complete

**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Status:** READY TO DEPLOY

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Added B-Line to Docker Compose Stacks

**Core Stack** (`docker-compose.core.yml`):
- âœ… Added manifest_ingestion service
- âœ… Added runtime_executor service
- âœ… Added b_line service
- âœ… Configured health checks
- âœ… Set up service dependencies
- âœ… Configured environment variables

**Full Stack** (`docker-compose.yml`):
- âœ… Added b_line service
- âœ… Removed old web_client service
- âœ… Configured same setup as core

### 2. Updated Environment Configuration

**Added to `infra/env/.env`:**
```bash
MANIFEST_INGESTION_HOST_PORT=8082
RUNTIME_EXECUTOR_HOST_PORT=8083
DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER_HOST_PORT=8084
B_LINE_HOST_PORT=3000
CHAT_TEST_HOST_PORT=8888
```

### 3. Updated Makefile

**Added Commands:**
```bash
make logs-b-line    # Follow B-Line dashboard logs
```

**Updated Phony Targets:**
- Added logs-b-line to phony targets list

## How to Use

### Option 1: Core Stack (Minimal)

```bash
# Start minimal stack with B-Line
make up STACK=core

# Services started:
# - Redis (cache)
# - LLM Gateway (AI provider)
# - Manifest Ingestion (registry)
# - Runtime Executor (execution engine)
# - B-Line Dashboard (web UI)
# - Chat Test (streaming test)
```

### Option 2: Full Stack (Complete)

```bash
# Start complete stack
make up

# Additional services:
# - Neo4j (graph database)
# - PostgreSQL (relational data)
# - API Gateway
# - Chimera Core
# - All other services
```

---

## Access Points

Once running:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **B-Line Dashboard** | http://localhost:3000 | Main web UI |
| Manifest Ingestion | http://localhost:8082 | API for manifests |
| Runtime Executor | http://localhost:8083 | Execution engine |
| LLM Gateway | http://localhost:8081 | AI provider |
| Chat Test | http://localhost:8888 | Streaming test |

## Service Dependencies

```
b_line (3000)
  â†“
  â”œâ”€â†’ manifest_ingestion (8082)
  â”‚     â†“
  â”‚     â””â”€â†’ [filesystem: /manifests]

## Docker Compose Configuration

### B-Line Service Definition

```yaml
b_line:
  build:
    context: ./services/b-line
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  container_name: ${PROJECT_NAME}_b_line_mk1
  restart: unless-stopped
  depends_on:
    manifest_ingestion:
      condition: service_healthy
    runtime_executor:
      condition: service_healthy
  ports:
    - "${B_LINE_HOST_PORT:-3000}:3000"
  environment:
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_MANIFEST_URL=http://manifest_ingestion:8082
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_RUNTIME_URL=http://runtime_executor:8083
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_URL=http://deployment_controller:8084
  networks:
    - cortex_prime_network
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:3000 || exit 1"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
    start_period: 15s
```

---

## Testing the Integration

### Step 1: Start Services

```bash
cd /home/mlamkadm/repos/Cortex-Prime-MK1

# Core stack
make up STACK=core

# Or full stack
make up
```

### Step 2: Check Health

```bash
# Check all services
make health

# Check specific service
curl http://localhost:3000        # B-Line
curl http://localhost:8082/health # Manifest Ingestion
curl http://localhost:8083/health # Runtime Executor
```

### Step 3: View Logs

```bash
# B-Line logs
make logs-b-line

# Manifest Ingestion logs
make logs-manifest

# All logs
make logs
```

### Step 4: Access Dashboard

Open browser: http://localhost:3000

**You should see:**
- Modern dark mode UI
- Sidebar with navigation
- Dashboard with stats cards
- Agents page (may be empty initially)

### Step 5: Test with Manifests

```bash
# Add a test agent manifest
cat > manifests/agents/test_agent/agent.yml << 'YAML'
kind: Agent
name: test_agent
version: "1.0"
summary: "Test agent for B-Line"
author: "tester"
state: "unstable"

persona:
  agent: "You are a helpful assistant."

cognitive_engine:
  primary:
    provider: "google"
    model: "gemini-1.5-flash"
YAML

# Wait a few seconds for hot-reload
sleep 3

# Check if manifest was ingested
curl http://localhost:8082/registry/agents

# View in B-Line
# Open http://localhost:3000/agents
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### B-Line Won't Start

```bash
# Check if dependencies are healthy
docker ps --filter "name=manifest_ingestion"
docker ps --filter "name=runtime_executor"

# Check build logs
make logs-b-line

# Rebuild
make rebuild service=b_line
```

### Can't Access Dashboard

```bash
# Verify port is exposed
docker ps | grep b_line

# Check if process is listening
curl -v http://localhost:3000

# Check container health
docker inspect cortex-prime-mk1_b_line_core | grep -A 5 Health
```

### API Connection Issues

```bash
# From inside b_line container
docker exec -it cortex-prime-mk1_b_line_core sh
curl http://manifest_ingestion:8082/health
curl http://runtime_executor:8083/health
```

## Known Issues

1. **First Build Takes Time** - Next.js app needs to install dependencies
   - Solution: Be patient, ~2-3 minutes for first build

2. **Hot Reload in Dev** - Volume mounts for dev not configured
   - Solution: Rebuild container after code changes in production mode

3. **No Data on First Load** - No manifests ingested yet
   - Solution: Add manifests to `/manifests` directory

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- [ ] Test with real manifests
- [ ] Verify hot-reload works for manifests
- [ ] Test agent execution (when implemented)

### Short Term

- [ ] Add WebSocket support for streaming
- [ ] Implement agent execution UI
- [ ] Add manifest editor

### Long Term

- [ ] Build Deployment Controller service
- [ ] Add Relic/Monument management
- [ ] Implement CLI tool

---

## Verification Checklist

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Start
make up STACK=core              # Core stack
make up                         # Full stack

# Stop
make down

# Restart
make restart

# Logs
make logs-b-line                # B-Line only
make logs                       # All services
make logs service=b_line        # Specific service

# Build
make build service=b_line       # Build B-Line
make rebuild service=b_line     # Rebuild from scratch

# Debug
make ssh service=b_line         # Shell into container
docker exec -it cortex-prime-mk1_b_line_core sh

# Health
make health                     # Check all services
curl http://localhost:3000      # Direct health check
```

---

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Integration Complete When:**

1. `make up STACK=core` starts without errors
2. B-Line dashboard accessible at http://localhost:3000
3. Dashboard loads and displays UI
4. API calls to manifest_ingestion succeed
5. Health checks pass for all services
6. Logs show no critical errors

---

## Rollback Plan

If integration fails:

```bash
# Stop everything
make down

# Remove B-Line service from docker-compose files
git checkout infra/docker-compose.yml
git checkout infra/docker-compose.core.yml

# Restore old web client if needed
git checkout services/web_client

# Restart
make up
```

---

**Status:** READY FOR TESTING  
**Risk Level:** LOW (isolated service, no schema changes)  
**Rollback:** EASY (git checkout)

---

**Next Command:** `make up STACK=core` ğŸš€
